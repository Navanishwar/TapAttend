# AccessMate â€“ RFID-Based Access Control System Using Arduino

AccessMate is a smart access control system developed using the Arduino platform and RFID technology. It allows users to scan RFID tags to control access, verify users, and trigger external actions like opening doors or logging entries. This project is ideal for building secure entry systems in homes, offices, and restricted areas.

## Features
- **Real-time Card Scanning**: Scans RFID tags and identifies users based on their unique UID.
- **Customizable Access Control**: Predefine allowed RFID UIDs to grant or deny access.
- **Serial Communication**: Sends signals to connected devices for further action.
- **Easy to Modify**: You can easily update the RFID UIDs in the code to manage which tags are allowed access.

## How It Works
1. The system continuously scans for RFID cards.
2. When a card is detected, it reads the card's UID and displays it in the Serial Monitor.
3. The system compares the UID with predefined UIDs.
4. If the UID matches, access is granted and a signal is sent via serial communication.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino UNO
- MFRC522 RFID Reader
- RFID Tags/Cards
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- External devices for serial output (e.g., door locks, alarms)
